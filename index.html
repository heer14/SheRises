  <h3 style="text-align: center; margin-top: 0;">A Tale of Two Journeys</h3>
  <!-- Paragraphs will be revealed one by one with typewriter effect -->
  <p>Every child is born with a universe of possibility. But the world they inherit shapes how far they can go.</p>

  <p>For Maya, the path is lined with invisible hurdles—expectations, doubts, and double standards. For Noah, the road is paved with encouragement, opportunity, and second chances. What begins as a gentle nudge in childhood becomes a widening gap by adulthood.</p>

  <p>Small moments add up: a missed lesson here, a discouraging word there. Maya is told to be careful, to help, to wait her turn. Noah is told to lead, to build, to dream big. These differences, repeated over years, quietly redirect dreams and ambitions until the gap is a chasm.</p>

  <p>Behind every statistic is a story: a girl who leaves school too soon, a woman passed over for promotion, a mother whose career stalls while her partner’s soars. By the time Maya and Noah reach their career peaks, the divide is stark. For every 100 men who achieve economic independence, only 30 women do. For every 100 men in leadership, just 28 women stand beside them. Parenthood deepens the split: after children, Maya’s career slows while Noah’s accelerates. Society rewards his ambition and questions hers.</p>

  <p>But the gender gap is not inevitable. It is built, brick by brick, by choices and traditions—and it can be dismantled the same way. Every classroom, every workplace, every home offers a chance to close the gap. True equality means more than opportunity; it means changing the rules, the culture, and the expectations that hold Maya back and push Noah forward.</p>

  <p>Imagine a world where Maya and Noah walk side by side, their choices shaped only by their passions, not by their gender. That world begins with us.</p>

  <div class="call-to-action">What will you do today to help close the gap?</div>

  <!-- Action steps will be revealed by a button after all paragraphs -->
  <div class="action-steps">
    <h4>Closing the Gap: What We Can Do</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Early Education:</strong> Challenge gender stereotypes in classrooms and learning materials. Encourage girls in STEM subjects and boys in empathy-building activities.</li>
      <li><strong>Workplace Policy:</strong> Implement transparent pay practices, flexible work arrangements, and paid parental leave for all genders.</li>
      <li><strong>Leadership Development:</strong> Create mentorship programs specifically designed to support women's advancement into leadership roles.</li>
      <li><strong>Shared Care Work:</strong> Promote equal distribution of unpaid care work through policy, social norms, and institutional support.</li>
      <li><strong>Data-Driven Decisions:</strong> Continue collecting and analyzing gender-disaggregated data to identify gaps and measure progress.</li>
    </ul>

  <h4>Breaking Stereotypes in Small Ways</h4>
  Did you notice that throughout this visualization, we used <span class="highlight-blue">blue</span> for Maya and <span class="highlight-pink">pink</span> for Noah—intentionally reversing traditional color associations?</p>
  
  Gender equality isn’t just built through policy changes—it begins with challenging our unconscious biases in everyday decisions. The colors we assign to children, the toys we select, the language we use, and the behaviors we encourage all shape how gender roles evolve.</p>
