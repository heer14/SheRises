  <h3 style="text-align: center; margin-top: 0;">A Tale of Two Journeys</h3>
  <!-- Paragraphs will be revealed one by one with typewriter effect -->
  <p>Maya and Noah's parallel stories illustrate how gender disparities manifest across the lifespan. What begins as subtle differences in childhood—the toys they're given, the behaviors encouraged, the expectations set—magnifies over time into significant economic divides.</p>
  
  <p>The data from the World Bank Gender Data Portal reveals that gender gaps in education directly translate to workforce disparities. But the workplace introduces additional barriers—harassment, unequal caregiving expectations, and subtle biases—that disproportionately affect women's advancement.</p>
  
  <p>By the time Maya and Noah reach their career peaks, the accumulated effect of these disparities is stark. For every 100 men who achieve economic independence, only 30 women reach the same milestone. For every 100 men in leadership roles, only 28 women share that achievement.</p>
  
  <p>The motherhood penalty and fatherhood premium create diverging trajectories for parents: after having children, women's career prospects often diminish while men's frequently improve. This reflects deeply embedded societal expectations about caregiving that continue to shape workforce outcomes.</p>
  
  <div class="call-to-action">The path to gender equality requires intervention at every stage—from early education to corporate leadership—and must address both workplace barriers and societal expectations around unpaid care work.</div>
  
  <!-- Action steps will be revealed by a button after all paragraphs -->
  <div class="action-steps">
    <h4>Closing the Gap: What We Can Do</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Early Education:</strong> Challenge gender stereotypes in classrooms and learning materials. Encourage girls in STEM subjects and boys in empathy-building activities.</li>
      <li><strong>Workplace Policy:</strong> Implement transparent pay practices, flexible work arrangements, and paid parental leave for all genders.</li>
      <li><strong>Leadership Development:</strong> Create mentorship programs specifically designed to support women's advancement into leadership roles.</li>
      <li><strong>Shared Care Work:</strong> Promote equal distribution of unpaid care work through policy, social norms, and institutional support.</li>
      <li><strong>Data-Driven Decisions:</strong> Continue collecting and analyzing gender-disaggregated data to identify gaps and measure progress.</li>
    </ul>

  <h4>Breaking Stereotypes in Small Ways</h4>
  Did you notice that throughout this visualization, we used <span class="highlight-blue">blue</span> for Maya and <span class="highlight-pink">pink</span> for Noah—intentionally reversing traditional color associations?</p>
  
  Gender equality isn't just built through policy changes—it begins with challenging our unconscious biases in everyday decisions. The colors we assign to children, the toys we select, the language we use, and the behaviors we encourage all shape how gender roles evolve.</p>
