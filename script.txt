**Slide/Section 1: Introduction**
- "Hello, we are Team She Rises—Hiral, Padmasree, and Madhu. Today, we invite you to walk in the shoes of Maya and Noah, two children born with equal potential but destined for very different journeys."

**Slide/Section 2: The Problem**
- "From the moment they are born, subtle biases begin to shape their futures. Maya, like millions of girls worldwide, is just as capable as her male peers. Yet, as she grows, she is encouraged to be careful, to help, to wait her turn—while boys like Noah are told to lead, to build, to dream big."
- "These early messages are not just words. They become expectations, shaping what subjects children pursue, how teachers treat them, and what careers they imagine for themselves."

**Slide/Section 3: The Journey Visualization (Demo Walkthrough)**
- "Our visualization traces Maya and Noah’s parallel journeys. Notice how, even though Maya excels in school, she is often steered away from STEM fields and leadership roles. She faces more household responsibilities, less encouragement, and more doubts about her abilities."
- "By the time they reach the workforce, the gap has widened. Maya is more likely to face pay gaps, fewer promotions, and greater pressure to balance work and family. Noah, meanwhile, benefits from networks and expectations that propel him forward."
- "This isn’t just about individual choices—it’s about a system that rewards ambition in men and questions it in women."

**Slide/Section 4: The Impact**
- "The result? For every 100 men who achieve economic independence, only 30 women do. For every 100 men in leadership, just 28 women stand beside them. The pay gap persists, not because women are less capable, but because the world expects less from them and gives them fewer opportunities."

**Slide/Section 5: Call to Action**
- "But this gap is not inevitable. It is built, brick by brick, by the choices we make as parents, teachers, employers, and as a society. And it can be dismantled the same way."
- "Every time we encourage a girl to pursue her interests, challenge a stereotype, or support equal opportunities, we help close the gap."

**Slide/Section 6: Closing**
- "Imagine a world where Maya and Noah walk side by side, their dreams shaped only by their passions—not by their gender. That world begins with us."
- "Thank you for joining us on this journey. Let’s rise together for equality."
