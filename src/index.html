<div class="journey-conclusion">
  <h3 style="text-align: center; margin-top: 0;">A Tale of Two Journeys</h3>
  <p>Maya and Noah's parallel stories illustrate how gender disparities manifest across the lifespan. What begins as subtle differences in childhood—the toys they're given, the behaviors encouraged, the expectations set—magnifies over time into significant economic divides.</p>
  
  <p>The data from the World Bank Gender Data Portal reveals that gender gaps in education directly translate to workforce disparities. But the workplace introduces additional barriers—harassment, unequal caregiving expectations, and subtle biases—that disproportionately affect women's advancement.</p>
  
  <p>By the time Maya and Noah reach their career peaks, the accumulated effect of these disparities is stark. For every 100 men who achieve economic independence, only 30 women reach the same milestone. For every 100 men in leadership roles, only 28 women share that achievement.</p>
  
  <p>The motherhood penalty and fatherhood premium create diverging trajectories for parents: after having children, women's career prospects often diminish while men's frequently improve. This reflects deeply embedded societal expectations about caregiving that continue to shape workforce outcomes.</p>
  
  <div class="call-to-action">The path to gender equality requires intervention at every stage—from early education to corporate leadership—and must address both workplace barriers and societal expectations around unpaid care work.</div>
